JSON
JSON  stands for JavaScript Object Notation.The JSON syntax is dervied from JavaScript
Object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only 
JSON is a light weight data format for storing and transporting.
JSON is mostly used when data is sent from a server to a client 
JSON is an easier to use alternative to XML



{
"users":[
  {
    "firstName":"Asabeneh",
    "lastName":"Yetayeh",
    "age":250,
    "email":"asab@asb.com"
  },
  {
    "firstName":"Alex",
    "lastName":"James",
    "age":25,
    "email":"alex@alex.com"
  },
  {
  "firstName":"Lidiya",
  "lastName":"Tekle",
  "age":28,
  "email":"lidiya@lidiya.com"
  }
]
}
the above JSON example is not much different from a natural object.Then the differnence is the key of 
a JavaScript object should be with double quotes or it should be a string.
JavaScript Object and JSON are very similar that we can change JSON to object and 
object to JSON

Let us see the above example in more detail,
It starts with a curly bracket.Inside the curly bracket, there is "users" key which has a value array
Inside the arry we have different objects and each object has keys,each key has to have double quotes 
for example we use "firstName" instead of firstName, however in object we use keys without the double quotes 
This is the major difference between  an object and JSON 

Let us see more examples of JSON

Converting JSON to JavaScript Object


Mostly we fetch JSON from HTTP response or from a file,but we can store the JSON as string
and we can change to Object for sake of demonstrartion. In JavaScript the keyword JSON
has parse() and stringify() methods.

When we want to change the JSON to an object we parse the JSON using JSON.parse()
When we want to change the object to an JSON we use JSON.stringify()
